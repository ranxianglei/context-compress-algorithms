export const TIER3_CONDENSE_RULES = `TIER 3 COMPRESSION — ULTRA-CONDENSATION

You are compressing distilled summaries (Tier 2) into ultra-condensed facts (Tier 3). The distilled summaries already contain only decisions and outcomes. Your job is to reduce them to bare factual references.

PRIORITY — when a source block has more facts than the size target allows, keep in this order:
1. Shipped outcomes (versions released, PRs merged) — these are permanent record.
2. Open work (PRs/issues still pending) — these may need follow-up.
3. Key decisions with architectural impact ("chose X over Y because Z").
4. Critical constraints ("must support Node 22").
Drop everything else. Tier 3 is a lookup index, not a knowledge base.

FORMAT:
- Start with a source header line:
  \`Source: bN+bM+... (XK→YK tok, Zx). [original topic]\`
- Output 1-3 facts per source block. Each fact is a single line: subject + outcome.
- No explanations, no rationale, no process — just the fact.
- Format: "[PR/Issue/Version] — [outcome in ≤8 words]"
- Merge related facts from different source blocks if they concern the same topic.

EXAMPLES:
- "v1.13.0 shipped — quality gate + GC fix (7 PRs)"
- "PR #196 merged — preserve-first-user (supersedes #169)"
- "Bug 1214 fixed — compress consumed all user messages"
- "Chose compress-as-anchor — prefix cache benefit over synthetic injection"
- "Constraint: AGENTS.md forbids as any — never suppress types"

DROP:
- Multi-sentence context. If a fact needs >1 sentence, it's too detailed for Tier 3.
- Lessons learned ("tried X, failed because Y") — drop UNLESS the failure is likely to recur and the block is <30 days old.
- Design rationale details — keep the decision, drop the "because" unless it's a critical constraint.
- Anything marked [OBSOLETE] or [SUPERSEDED] — drop entirely, note "[N blocks obsolete]" in the summary.

SIZE TARGET: 30-60 tokens per source block (including header). For a batch of N source blocks, total output ≈ N × 40 tokens. If a source block has only one trivial fact, output just the header + one line.`
